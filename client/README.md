First, I sincerely apologize for the late submission. I was unwell throughout the week and barely managed to keep up with the course. Despite the setback, this project was an exciting experience for me, and I learned a great deal in the process.

I relied heavily on Manny’s notes as well as a helpful YouTube tutorial (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6D9cBaLViA&t=952s ) to guide me through key aspects of the project. While those resources provided structure, I also used my own notes to adapt the code and fine-tune functionalities to fit my specific goals.

The server setup, database integration, and backend logic were entirely my contributions, following the course guidelines and resources.

There were several features I hoped to implement but couldn't, due to time constraints and limited opportunity for deeper research:

Toggle Favorite Button: I intended for the heart icon to toggle between "like" and "unlike", triggering both insert and delete routes for managing favorites in the database.

Duplicate Prevention: I considered using useState to keep track of liked movies in real time—even across search results—to prevent duplicates in the database.

Styling: The UI/UX design is still incomplete. I planned to polish the styling and improve responsiveness across devices.

User Authentication: My long-term vision included a login system to store and fetch each user's favorite movies dynamically.

This past week was especially challenging—not due to the course itself—but because of some personal circumstances that were beyond my control.

Still, I’m committed to doing better. Thank you for your understanding and continued support.
